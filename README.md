# Dotfiles of stewa02
## Contents
Repository for all my configuration files. Currently configuration for following
software is included:

 * vim: .vimrc and .vim folder with all plugins and colorschemes used
 * bash: .bashrc and and a little Perl script downloading news using RSS feeds
   (documentation in Perl script).
 * emacs: only .emacs, basically just to have a configuration for emacs, to make
   it work like vim (using evil-mode).
 * mutt: muttrc and colorscheme
 * tmux: .tmux.conf and a shell script getting information on the song currently
   being played in Banshee (documentation in shell script).

## Usage
This repository is mainly for me to make the set up of a new system a little bit
easier and to sync configurations across systems more easily.
